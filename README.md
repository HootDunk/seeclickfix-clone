I threw this repo together to prototype a map based UI for exploring incident requests based on a SaaS site called SeeClickFix (link to example tenant [here](https://seeclickfix.com/web_portal/E79oLnFioicWGNJ1z93qEujE/issues/map?lat=36.063200000000045&lng=-94.15790999999996&max_lat=36.078323995247494&max_lng=-94.12649596801758&min_lat=36.04807309696954&min_lng=-94.18932403198232&zoom=14))

Below is a gif showing the basic functionality.  The quality and framerate was downgraded a ton when I converted it to a gif so apologies for that.
